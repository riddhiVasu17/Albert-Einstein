           Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born scientist. He worked on theoretical physics.
           He developed the theory of relativity. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for theoretical physics. 
           His famous equation is {\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}{\displaystyle E=mc^{2}} (E = energy, m = mass, c = speed of light).

           At the beginning of his career, Einstein did not think that Newtonian mechanics was enough to reconcile (bring together) the
           laws of classical mechanics and the laws of the electromagnetic field. Between 1902–1909 he developed the theory of special 
           relativity to correct that. Einstein also thought that Isaac Newton's idea of gravity was not completely correct. So, he extended 
           his ideas on special relativity to include gravity. In 1916 he published a paper on general relativity with his theory of gravitation.

           The theory of special relativity was published by Einstein in 1905, in the paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies. 
           It says that both distance measurements and time measurements change near the speed of light. This means that as one get closer
           to the speed of light (nearly 300,000 kilometres per second), lengths appear to get shorter, and clocks tick more slowly. 
           Einstein said that special relativity is based on two ideas. The first is that the laws of physics are the same for all observers 
           that are not moving in relation to each other.
